# This is an implementation of the Soft-K Means Algorithm using the hidden matrix to update the center clusters.

# Directions
### Use the relative file path in the main function to point to the file you want read in. 
### The resulting centers are printed in the terminal output

# These instructions give more information about the file structure and the running of the algorithm
